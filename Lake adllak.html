                    <i>Despite limited resources, the integrated approach for sustainable management of Tadlac Lake has been successful due to community awareness about proper lake usage through self-adopted practices. The lake is no longer heavily relied upon for daily subsistence by fishermen as Laguna de Bay serves as an alternative site for livelihoods. The younger generation is also becoming professionals through education outside the community while community leaders have convinced fish cage operators to leave the lake. 

                        The lake has transformed into a clean and tranquil body of water, and the Barangay Tadlac FARMC received recognition for their conservation efforts. Other local government units and organizations visit Barangay Tadlac to learn about their achievements. The town of Los Baños has chosen Barangay Tadlac as a pilot barangay for a solid waste management program. The community, NGOs, and Barangay Council are hopeful that the new LLDA General Manager will renew the commitment to prepare a Tadlac Lake Master Plan.
                        
                        The community, LLDA, and local government are major players in the development of Barangay Tadlac and Tadlac Lake, and recognition and resources are needed to honor their efforts.
